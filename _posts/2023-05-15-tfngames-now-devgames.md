It happened! TFNGames is now DevGames. We will explain why that happened in this post.

## WHY IS TFNGAMES NOW DEVGAMES?
There is actually no reason why this happened but we are happy to have a new name. Also there are some new things with **DevGames** like Sierra the Discord Bot, better support, updated account system*

## ARE THERE ANY CHANGES?
Yea, we have some changes:
1. DevNite now supports DevGames API which is better than the old API and it supports faster hotfixes through the new [Unreal Engine Version]() we use (also the UEDN aka Unreal Editor for Devnite use a modified version of our Engine), faster matchmaking times in our online games, the DevNite Ranked mode is now called "Scoring" and will support better rewards**
2. With the new Account system its possible to create accounts via Discord (by using Sierra), use "Login with Google/Apple", and more
3. Also our games are now using "Developed by DevGames" and in DevNite, SYNL: Berlin, SYNL: Los Angeles you'll receive an cosmetic item called "Stand with TFNGames" with the Message "**Thanks for playing this game! Since TFNGames is now DevGames we'll grant you this cosmetic item. Have fun!**"

*The account system will release on 16th September 2023
